# FFXI/easyspells
 
Easyspells is a relatively simple addon that will auto-tier certain spells based on the following conditions:
- The spell is learned.
- The spell is usable by your current job/subjob.
- You have the mp to cast the spell.

The purpose is to use easyspells commands in your macros as you level or if you simple want to have an all-in-one macro for spamming fires, as an example.

## How to Use
typing /es <spell> will cast the appropriate tier of the spell.
If using in macros, use /console es <spell>
